📝 Day 3 Notes – MindMancer

✔️ Goal: Add automated breaks, motivational reinforcement, and session analysis.

---

1. ✅ BreakSessionManager
   - Inherits from SessionManager
   - Takes a TimerCount reference
   - Uses `TimerCount % 4 == 0` logic for long breaks
   - Respects base `startTask()`/`stopTask()` structure

2. ✅ MotivationalQuoteManager
   - Inherits from TaskManager
   - Shows a new quote every N seconds
   - Uses `srand()` to randomize
   - Output via `update()`

3. ✅ SessionSummary
   - Reads log file written by TaskLogger
   - Extracts `started`, `Paused`, `Resumed`, `ended` lines
   - Computes accurate active time
   - Outputs total time and durations

---

🧪 Testing Approach:
- Break test: Assert timer starts
- Quote test: Print quotes for 3 seconds
- Summary test: Print parsed result

---

💡 Challenges Faced:
- Had to reintroduce `myLogger` via constructor into `SessionManager`
- Needed platform-compatible input (termios on Linux)

---

🧩 Result:
> Successfully tested and integrated break detection, motivational updates, and log summaries into Day 3 system.
