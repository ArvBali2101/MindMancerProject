# ✅ Day 2 – Work Timer with Pause / Resume / Stop

## 🎯 Objective
Implement a work session timer (like Pomodoro) with:
- Countdown logic
- Pause (p), Resume (r), and Stop (s)
- Threaded timer logic
- Inheritance-based class structure
- Clean folder layout, Makefile, README, and Notes

## 🔧 Features Implemented
- `SessionManager`: base timer class with state and controls
- `WorkSessionManager`: manages a Pomodoro-style session
- `TimerCount`: tracks number of sessions completed
- Key input for pause/resume/stop (Windows-compatible)
- Live CLI-driven timer

## 🧪 Testing
- `TestWorkSessionManager.cpp` added under `test/`
- Unit tests for:
  - setSessionDuration()
  - incrementTimerCount()
  - pause/resume flow
- Use `make test_work` to run tests

## 🛠️ Run Instructions
```bash
make day2       # Build and run Day 2
make test_day2  # Compile and run test file
make clean      # Delete binaries
