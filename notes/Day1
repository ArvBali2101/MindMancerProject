# 🗓️ Day 1 – Authenticator Module

## ✅ What I Did
- Created `Authenticator` class
- Handles password check and tracks login attempts
- Added simulated test with colored output
- Wrote Makefile to build/run test easily

## 🧪 Test Logic
- Hardcoded attempts: {"welcome1", "welcome1", "welcome"}
- Should succeed on 3rd attempt
- Displays colors (red, green, blue)

## 🔧 Commands

```bash
make day1 #Run day1
make test_day1  # Compile and run test
make clean     # Remove compiled binary
